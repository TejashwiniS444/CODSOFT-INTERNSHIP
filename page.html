        <h2>A Life of Groundbreaking Achievements</h2>
        <p>Marie Curie was a trailblazing scientist who became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and remains the only woman to win the award in two different fields. Her discoveries of radium and polonium fundamentally changed our understanding of radioactivity, a term she herself coined.</p>

        <h2>Scientific Legacy</h2>
        <p>Her research on radioactivity laid the groundwork for numerous modern applications in science and medicine. During World War I, she developed mobile X-ray units that saved countless soldiers' lives. Her dedication to science was matched only by her commitment to education and mentoring future generations of scientists.</p>

        <h2>Breaking Barriers</h2>
        <p>In an era when women were largely excluded from higher education and scientific research, Marie Curie broke through countless barriers. She became the first female professor at the University of Paris and established the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw, which remain major research centers to this day.</p>
